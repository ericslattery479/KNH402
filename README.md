Error, Cost, and Recruiting document. This code will validate measurements that were measured and recorded, check the amount of displosable equipment used with cost, and display recruitment numbers for a specified time period. This was typically run after data collection.

Error Checking: This code systematically reviews measurements to identify potential input errors, deviations from an acceptable biological range, and adherence to standard operation procedures for each piece of equipment. Its purpose is to provide swift feedback, enabling conversations with students responsible for the measurements. This proactive approach helps mitigate future errors in the measurement process.

Cost Analysis: When measuring blood lipids, various disposables are required for each measurement. It's crucial to optimize their usage. This code aims to compare the expected usage with the actual usage, allowing us to investigate reasons for potential excess usage. This information helps enhance instructions on proper technique, identify issues, and minimize unnecessary consumption.

Recruitment: This code reviews how many people we had scheduled, showed up to the lab, missed, and how many we could have potentially scheduled to provide feedback to Intercollegiate Athletes on how well they were scheduling Athletes for the days our class could meet to collect data. Typically, the classes were Tuesday or Thursday from 7am-9:00am, with 3 athletes scheduled for every 20 minute timeblock, for a max of 18 athletes scheduled per time we meet.
